## About

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle.

In [Classic Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku "Visit Sudoku's wikipedia page"), the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

The [Killer Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_sudoku "Visit Killer Sudoku's wikipedia page") variant combines elements of Sudoku and Kakuro. A killer sudoku puzzle is made up of 'cages', typically depicted by boxes outlined with dashes or colours. The sum of the numbers in a cage is written in the top left corner of the cage, and numbers cannot be repeated in a cage.

The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

[Sudoku-Qt](https://rstammdev.github.io/sudoku-qt "Visit project's homepage") is a free open-source game for these Sudoku games written in C++ using the Qt framework.
